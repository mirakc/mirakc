# Web API

Web API endpoints listed below have been implemented at this moment:

| ENDPOINT                                        | COMPATIBLE WITH MIRAKURUN? |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| [/api/version]                                  |                            |
| [/api/status]                                   |                            |
| [/api/channels]                                 | :heavy_check_mark:         |
| [/api/channels/{channel_type}/{channel}/stream] | :heavy_check_mark:         |
| [/api/channels/{channel_type}/{channel}/services/{sid}/stream] |             |
| [/api/channels]                                 | :heavy_check_mark:         |
| [/api/services]                                 | :heavy_check_mark:         |
| [/api/services/{id}]                            | :heavy_check_mark:         |
| [/api/services/{id}/stream]                     | :heavy_check_mark:         |
| [/api/programs]                                 | :heavy_check_mark:         |
| [/api/programs/{id}]                            | :heavy_check_mark:         |
| [/api/programs/{id}/stream]                     | :heavy_check_mark:         |
| [/api/tuners]                                   | :heavy_check_mark:         |
| [/api/docs]                                     | :heavy_check_mark:         |
| [/api/iptv/playlist]                            |                            |
| [/api/iptv/epg]                                 |                            |

The endpoints above are enough to run [EPGStation].

It also enough to run [BonDriver_mirakc].  It's strongly recommended to
enable `SERVICE_SPLIT` in `BonDriver_mirakc.ini` in order to reduce network
traffic between mirakc and BonDriver_mirakc.  Because the
`/api/channels/{channel_type}/{channel}/stream` endpoint provides a **raw** TS
stream which means that all TS packets from a tuner will be sent even though
some of them don't need for playback.

Unfortunately, mirakc doesn't work with [BonDriver_Mirakurun] at this point due
to some kind of issue in BonDriver_Mirakurun or mirakc.
See [issues/4](https://github.com/mirakc/mirakc/issues/4) for details
(discussion in Japanese).

Web API endpoints listed below have been implemented as the mirakc extensions:

* [/api/iptv/playlist]

[/api/version]: #apiversion
[/api/status]: #apistatus
[/api/channels]: #apichannels
[/api/channels/{channel_type}/{channel}/stream]: #apichannelschannel_typechannelstream
[/api/channels/{channel_type}/{channel}/services/{sid}/stream]: #apichannelschannel_typechannelservicessidstream
[/api/services]: #apiservices
[/api/services/{id}]: #apiservicesid
[/api/services/{id}/stream]: #apiservicesidstream
[/api/programs]: #apiprograms
[/api/programs/{id}]: #apiprogramsid
[/api/programs/{id}/stream]: #apiprogramsidstream
[/api/tuners]: #apituners
[/api/docs]: #apidocs
[/api/iptv/playlist]: #apiiptvplaylist

## Incompatibility of the `X-Mirakurun-Priority` header

There are the following differences of the `X-Mirakurun-Priority` header between
mirakc and Mirakurun:

* Treated as 0 when the minimum value of `X-Mirakurun-Priority` headers is less
  than 0
* Treaded as 128 when the maximum value of `X-Mirakurun-Priority` headers is
  greater than 0
* Can grab a tuner which is used by other users regardless of their priorities
  if the priority is 128

## /api/version

Returns the version string.

## /api/status

Returns an empty object.

## /api/channels

Returns a list of channels.

Query parameters have **NOT** been supported.

## /api/channels/{channel_type}/{channel}/stream

Starts streaming for a channel.

## /api/channels/{channel_type}/{channel}/services/{sid}/stream

Starts streaming for a service in a channel.

Unlike Mirakurun, the `sid` must be a service ID.  In Mirakurun, the `sid` is a
service ID or an ID of the `ServiceItem` class.

## /api/services

Returns a list of services.

Query parameters have **NOT** been supported.

## /api/services/{id}

Returns a service.

## /api/services/{id}/stream

Starts streaming for a service.

## /api/programs

Returns a list of programs.

Query parameters have **NOT** been supported.

## /api/programs/{id}

Returns a program.

## /api/programs/{id}/stream

Starts streaming for a program.

The streaming will starts when the program starts and stops when the program
ends.

## /api/tuners

Returns a list of tuners.

Query parameters have **NOT** been supported.

## /api/docs

Returns a Swagger JSON data extracted from a Mirakurun by using the following
command:

```shell
./scripts/mirakurun-openapi-json -c -w 10 $MIRAKURUN_VERSION | \
  ./scripts/fixup-openapi-json >/etc/mirakurun.openapi.json
```

## Web API endpoints for IPTV clients

Using these endpoints, you can integrate mirakc with IPTV clients which support
the M3U8 playlist and the XMLTV document.

For example, you can integrate mirakc with PVR IPTV Simple Client in Jodi with
the following settings:

* General | M3U Play List URL
  * `http://<host>:<port>/api/iptv/playlist`
* EPG Settings | XMLTV URL
  * `http://<host>:<port>/api/iptv/epg`

After rebooting the Kodi, the following features will be available:

* TV
  * Channels
  * Guide
* Radio (if channels defined in `config.yml` have audio-only services)
  * Channels
  * Guide

### /api/iptv/playlist

Returns a M3U8 playlist which includes all TV services.

The format of the M3U8 playlist is compatible with EPGStation.

The following query parameters can be specified:

* pre-filters
* post-filters

The specified query parameters are added to URLs in the playlist.

### /api/iptv/epg

Returns a XMLTV document which contains TV program information for a specified
number of days.

The following query parameters can be specified:

* days (1-8)
